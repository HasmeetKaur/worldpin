## Summary

Bright Network Technology Academy has tasked us with producing an API using Spring, which is connected to a website/application where user infromation (in our case their pins containing images, description, date and location) is stored in a Database. Our team have used this opportunity to come up with something creative and original- an app that is the only of it's kind.


## Set-up

1.First ensure that Java 17 is installed to run the game.

2.Clone this repository by clicking the green 'code' sign on top of this page. Click the SSH key and type in your terminal the following: git clone "https://github.com/bendesousa/bnta_capstone_project".

3.Open up and run the file in IntelliJ.

4.Make sure you have SQL downloaded and a database created through Terminal with the command: createdb worldpin.
Open up Postman to start the requests.
